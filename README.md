# TDD Test Driven Development
## Why should we use TDD
### what are the benefits of using TDD

**Best Use Cases** 
- We will use Pytest unittest in Python to implement TDD
- TDD is widely used and is the cheapest way to test the code or implement test driven development 

**Best practices for TDD**
- Write the smallest possible test case that matches what we need program
- TDD cycle start with everything failing - `RED`
- Write code to pass the test `GREEN`
- Refactor the code for next test `BLUE`
- This continues until all the test have successfully passed 

There are also numerous assertions that are inherited from the TestCase base class, assertions are everything in testing...

|Method |	Checks that|	New in |
|:---|:---|:---|
|assertEqual(a, b)        | a == b              ||
|assertNotEqual(a, b)     |	a != b              ||	 
|assertTrue(x)            |	bool(x) is True     ||	 
|assertFalse(x)           |	bool(x) is False    ||	 
|assertIs(a, b)           |	a is b	            |3.1|
|assertIsNot(a, b)        |	a is not b          |3.1|
|assertIsNone(x)          |	x is None           |3.1|
|assertIsNotNone(x)       |	x is not None       |3.1|
|assertIn(a, b)           |	a in b              |3.1|
|assertNotIn(a, b)        |	a not in b	        |3.1|
|assertIsInstance(a, b)   |	isinstance(a, b)    |3.2|
|assertNotIsInstance(a, b)|	not isinstance(a, b)|3.2| 

- Let's create file called `test_unittest_simplecalc.py`
- Naming convention is extremely important when it comes to TDD in Python
